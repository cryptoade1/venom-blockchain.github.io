### Introduction

Venom is a novel layer 1 asynchronous blockchain protocol that provides a strong foundation for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and Web 3.0 applications. The blockchain network is designed to serve the needs of the Middle East, North Africa, and other emerging economies around the world.

Venom protocol is powered by decentralized governance and ADGM regulatory framework, representing a unique system for mass adoption of blockchain technology. The network is developed with massive deployments that address most of the fundamental issues faced by existing blockchain protocols, especially in terms of security and scalability.

Opposed to widespread EVM-based blockchains like Ethereum which heavily rely on rollups for scaling, Venom uses Threaded Virtual Machine (TVM) to provide the best transactional scalability solution via its infinite sharding protocol and economic scalability by enabling the running of community-built workchains in the future.

This solution allows Venom to offer one of the highest Transaction Per Second rates (1 million + TPS) available among currently operating blockchains. The venom blockchain is a Turing-complete proof-of-stake protocol that uses Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus approach to validate and execute transactions as well as secure the network. This allows the distributed network to reach a consensus even when some nodes fail to respond or respond with incorrect information.

Venom also provides an ideal development environment for developers. The superior virtual machine - TVM it uses allows the protocol to easily execute smart contracts and gives more flexibility and controlled flow over the execution of application logic. With it, developers can effortlessly build smart contracts with Solidity using our [development guides and resources](https://docs.venom.foundation/build/development-guides/).

**How Venom Achieves High TPS**

The ability of venom blockchain to process over 1 million transactions per second boils down to its flexible asynchronous architecture. It has a robust design that makes it scalable and shardable, allowing it to achieve high throughput at a low cost and with no loss of performance.

A distinctive core feature of the protocol is that it is a heterogeneous multi-blockchain platform with dynamic sharding. This ensures that its core components - masterchain, workchains, and shardchains, can create smaller, faster processing pieces referred to as shards. With shards, more transactions can be processed simultaneously and in parallel, thus increasing scalability.

The Masterchain must keep track of the states of the workchains and shardchains (each validator is responsible for validating and creating new blocks in a certain subset of workchains and shardchains), perform all computations requested by the smart contracts in these components, and receive updates about them.

The mechanism of block verification is done by a random validator set from a global set. This help to decrease the threshold of the consensus validation, reducing the amount of time necessary for block finality while simultaneously improving the thread security.

You can find more information about the different components of its architecture in [this section](https://docs.venom.foundation/learn/architecture) of our documentation.
